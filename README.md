# INTRODUCTION

The main objective of this project has been to implement the "CYK Decision Algorithm" to determine whether a word belongs to a language generated by a context-free grammar.

# DESIGN DECISIONS
- This project employs three data structures. Non-terminal and terminal elements are stored in an ArrayList of characters to take advantage of the versatility of variable-sized arrays and maintain control over the position of the data. If desired, this could also be implemented using LinkedList.
Productions are stored in a HashMap, where the key is a Character and the value is an ArrayList of strings. This allows saving the non-terminal element as the key and the combinations of non-terminal elements or the single terminal element as strings in the array list.
- Other elements present in the class are:
The startSymbol, represented as a single Character, as it should be represented by a single non-terminal element.
The table where the process is stored is represented by a two-dimensional array of Strings. The first dimension represents the rows and the second represents the columns, and the Strings are interpreted as concatenated non-terminal Characters to avoid dealing with the fixed size of a matrix and make the code more readable than implementing a two-dimensional array of ArrayLists.
Access to all attributes is private and can only be modified by class methods.

The word verification algorithm begins with the "isDerived" method.
At the beginning, consistency checks are performed on the data, then the matrix is created by delegating the task to the createMatrix() method. Finally, the result present in the last cell of the table is taken, and it is checked if the "startSymbol" is contained. Otherwise, the method returns false.

The "createMatrix" method is divided into three parts:
Initialization of the table.
Filling the first line of the table by calculating the individual characters of the word.
Filling the remaining cells of the table using an algorithm that follows these steps:
Extraction of the column of strings "above" the cell to be calculated using the "getColumn" method.
Extraction of the diagonal cells using the "getDiagonal" method.

As mentioned earlier, the "getDiagonal" and "getColumn" methods are responsible for extracting the relevant cells needed to calculate the current cell of the table. These extracted cells are later used in the "getCombinationsResult" method:

In this method, two arrays of strings obtained from the previous methods are iterated. The index "i" is used to iterate through all cells of the two arrays. Then, the two "for" loops with indices J and K respectively point to the characters of the first string and the second string, generating all possible combinations. With the last "for" loop, the presence of these combinations in the "productions" HashMap is checked, and if found, the key value will be added to the string that will be returned from the method.

# CONCLUSIONS
This project has involved me for several hours over two weeks, totaling approximately 20 hours. Undoubtedly, the code could be improved by implementing more efficient methods, but it would only improve a few percentage points. I am generally satisfied with my work and excited to have programmed in a highly controlled environment, where my implementations had to be based on those that had already been done by someone else, as is the case in our sector.
